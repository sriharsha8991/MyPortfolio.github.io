                <p>
                    The banking sector is highly competitive, and retaining customers is of paramount importance. The Bank Customer Churn Prediction project aims to address this challenge by predicting the likelihood of a customer leaving the bank. Using a comprehensive dataset that includes various customer attributes, the project applies machine learning algorithms to analyze and predict churn patterns. After preprocessing the data, multiple algorithms were tested, with SVM and Naive Bayes algorithms proving to be the most accurate. With this predictive model, banks can identify potential churn risks and implement strategies to enhance customer retention.
